# Product-sale
Overview of project and business goals
The project we are working on is of product sales from the company Pens and Printers.
The company launched a new product and the goal for our analysis is to find out the best sales strategies
to use. The executive team is to be updated on the sales approaches to use for the new product line.
The sales methods include (Email, Call and a combination of Email+Call)
They need to know the following:
- Number of customers in for each approach.
- The spread of the revenue overall and for each method.
- Was there any difference in revenue over time for each of the methods?
- which method would you recommend we continue to use? 
The choice of the  methods should consider time and resources used.
